# This is a simple Java Swing-based To-Do List Application that allows users to efficiently manage tasks. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following functionalities:

Add Tasks: Users can input tasks in a text field and add them to the list using an "Add Task" button.
Remove Tasks: Users can select a task from the list and delete it using a "Remove Task" button.
Task Display: All tasks are displayed in a scrollable list, making it easy to review and manage tasks.
Interactive GUI: Built with Java Swing, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface.
The program is organized with a clear structure, using JFrame for the main window, JTextField for task input, JList for task management, and DefaultListModel to dynamically update the task list.

I am open to collaborating with other developers to enhance and improve this application further.
